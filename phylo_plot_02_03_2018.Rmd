###1.Introduction
Phylogenetic trees are one the basic tools used in a large number of evolutionary, ecological or molecular studies. In principle, they can be used to depict relationships (distance) among any kind of objects, but more usually among taxa or other biological entities (individuals, species, family, orders). In addition, having a phylogenetic tree is a necessery step in a number of analyses such as trait evolution[^1], diversification rates[^2] or molecular dating[^3].

Given their ubiquitous presence in evolutionary biology, a number of methodological approaches exist to build them (e.g. Maximum Likelihood, Neighbour Joining, Bayesian), and represent them (e.g. Figtree[^4], MEGA[^5]). Here, I will provide a few examples on how to use R to draw and manipulate them, using two common R packages (phytools[^6],also check the phytools blog[^7], and ape[^8]). I will purposefully not present any data manipulation using Hadley Wickham's ggplot2[^9] package, given that the methodology and syntax used in the tidyverse[^10] are quite different from the base R[^11] (whether it is "better" is another topic and a matter of opinion I think). Also note that this post was done entirely using Rmarkdown[^12] and knitr[^13], fun tools to create html, pdf, or even Word documents.

I use this as a very brief introduction (and certainly non exhaustive) to plotting phylogenies in R, which I hope you will modify to fit your own datasets. In the future, I'd like to expand on this topic. Comments, questions, things you'd like to see done are welcomed!

###2.Basic plots
```{r basics,fig.width=4.5,fig.height=4.5,fig.show='hold',message=FALSE}
#Libraries
library(ape)
library(phytools)

#Dataset examples
data(bird.orders)

#Set up margins
par(mar = c(2,2,2,2))

#Slightly better than default plot
phylo = plot.phylo(bird.orders, edge.width = 1, label.offset = 1,cex = 0.4, main = "Figure 1 (basic)")

#Dropping a group (tip) altogether
bird.orders_nopass = drop.tip(bird.orders,"Passeriformes")
plot.phylo(bird.orders_nopass, edge.width = 1, label.offset = 1,cex = 0.4, main = "Figure 2 (dropped tip)")

#Dropping several tips
#First, make a backbone of interest dropping some tips
bird.orders.backbone =(drop.tip(bird.orders, c(1:5,9:12), subtree = TRUE))

#adjust branch length (this is hard to implement...)
bird.orders.backbone$edge.length[c(1,9)] = c(28,24.4)

##Create a translation table
trans<-data.frame(c("[5_tips]","[4_tips]"),c("Clade A","Clade B"),c(5,4),c(24,20))
colnames(trans) = c("tip.label","clade.label","N","depth")

#Create a object of classs "backbonePhylo" and plot with phytools 
bird.orders.backbone2=phylo.toBackbone(bird.orders.backbone,trans)
plot(bird.orders.backbone2, edge.width = 1, label.offset = 1,cex = 0.4,main = "Figure 3 (dropped tips)")


#bird.orders.drops =(drop.tip(bird.orders, c(9:12), subtree = TRUE))
#bird.orders.drops$tip.label[bird.orders.drops$tip.label=="[4_tips]"] = "clade A (4 tips)"
#plot.phylo(bird.orders.drops, edge.width = 1, label.offset = 1,cex = 0.4, main = "Figure 3 (dropped tips)")

#Unrooted tree
plot.phylo(bird.orders,type="unrooted", edge.width = 1, label.offset = 2,cex= 0.4, main = "Figure 4 (unrooted)")
```

###3.Slightly more complex (colours)
```{r more}

#Set up new plotting region
plot.new()
plot.window(xlim = phylo$x.lim,ylim = phylo$y.lim)

#Three colors vector (red, blue, purple in hexadecimal, with last two digits as the transparency)
colors = c("#FF000060","#0000ff60","#551a8b60")

#Add rectangles
rect(phylo$x.lim[1],0.5,phylo$x.lim[2],5.5,col = colors[1],border = F) #group 1
rect(phylo$x.lim[1],6.5,phylo$x.lim[2],12.5,col = colors[2], border = F) #group 2
rect(phylo$x.lim[1],13.5,phylo$x.lim[2],23.5, col = colors[3],border = F) #group 3

#Add phylo
par(new = T)
plot.phylo(bird.orders, edge.width = 2, label.offset = 1, main = "Figure 5 (colouring)")

#Add a x axis that looks decent
axis(1,at =seq(from =0, to = phylo$x.lim[2], by = 2),cex.axis = 0.5)

#It looks good, save it with dev.print if you want
#dev.print(dev = pdf, "phylo_more.pdf");dev.off()
```

###4.Multiple plots combined in layout
```{r layout}
#Setup layout as a 3 X 3 matrix with 3 regions (region 1 for the phylo tree, 2 for a x/y scatter and 3 for legend)
m = matrix(c(2,1,1,2,1,1,3,1,1), 3, 3, byrow = TRUE)
layout(m)

#Save plot.phylo parameters, without plotting yet
phylo = plot.phylo(bird.orders, edge.width = 2, label.offset = 1, plot = F, cex = 1)

#REGION 1: add boxes based on the y axis coordinates, the x-axis coord. are based on the phylogeny, and your groups of interest
rect(phylo$x.lim[1],0.5,phylo$x.lim[2],5.5,col = colors[1],border = F) #group 1
rect(phylo$x.lim[1],6.5,phylo$x.lim[2],12.5,col = colors[2], border = F) #group 2
rect(phylo$x.lim[1],13.5,phylo$x.lim[2],23.5, col = colors[3],border = F) #group 3

#Add phylogeny on top of rectangles
par(new = T)
phylo = plot.phylo(bird.orders, edge.width = 2, label.offset = 1, cex = 1, main = "Figure 6 (3 plots in layout)")

#Add an x axis that looks decent
axis(1,at =seq(from = 0, to = round(phylo$x.lim[2]), by = 2),cex.axis = 0.5)

#Make the segment for Turniciformes dashed (find out the x/y coordinates of the segment, color it white, then dashed red on top)
segments(1,6,28,6,col = "white", lwd = 4, lty = 1)
segments(1,6,28,6,col = "black", lwd = 4, lty = 3)

#REGION 2: set up some wider margins for region # 2 of layout
par(mar = c(11,4,11,0))

#Set up some fake data (say fake PCA data) for the 3 groups
pca = cbind(c(rnorm(6,mean=0,sd =1), rnorm(7,mean=2,sd =0.5),rnorm(10,mean=3,sd =0.5)),c(rnorm(6,mean=0,sd =1), rnorm(7,mean=0,sd =0.3),rnorm(10,mean=3,sd =0.2)))
rownames(pca) = bird.orders$tip.label

#Colors scheme according to boxes in phylo tree (5 red,1 black, 6 blue, 1 black, 10 purple)
colors_according_to_tree = c(rep(colors[1],5),"black",rep(colors[2],6),"black",rep(colors[3],10))

#Add another x/y scatter plot in region # 2 of layout
plot(pca,col = colors_according_to_tree,lwd =3,pch = 21, ylab = "random variable 1", xlab = "random variable 2")

#REGION 3: reset margins and empty plot
par(mar = c(5,4,4,2))
plot(1, type="n", xlab="", ylab="", xlim=c(0, 1), ylim=c(0, 1),xaxt="n",yaxt= "n", bty = "n")

#Add a legend here
legend(0.1,1.5,legend = c("group1","group2","group3"),fill = colors,xpd = T, cex = 2)

#It looks good, save it with dev.print if you want
#dev.print(dev = pdf, "phylo_layout.pdf"); dev.off()
```


###5.Adding coloured trait values
```{r traits}
###Add a trait value to the tree and plot it (trait object is based on the 3 colored grouping I did above)
trait1 = c(sample(c(0:25),6),c(sample(25:75,6)),sample(c(75:100),11))
names(trait1) = bird.orders$tip.label

#Use contMap from phytools
tree.trait <- contMap(bird.orders, trait1, plot = F)
tree.trait<-setMap(tree.trait, colors=c("darkgreen","darkorange","blue"))

#Carefull, we now plot using the plotting tool from phytools
plot.contMap(tree.trait,type = "phylogram",legend = 0.4*max(nodeHeights(bird.orders)), fsize = c(0.9, 0.7), lwd=3,mar = c(3,4,3,2))

#Add a title manually to plot.contMap
title("Figure 7 (adding branch colors according to trait 1)",xpd = T)
```

###6.Adding pie charts + tip colors
```{r pies}
#Add node labels (pie charts could be based on a genetic structuring analysis, or another trait value)
#You need a matrix defining your pies that can be generated as such:
pies = matrix(0,nrow =bird.orders$Nnode,ncol=2)
for(i in 1:bird.orders$Nnode) {x = sample(seq(0,1,by = 0.001),1); pies[i,] = c(x,1-x)}

#Plot
plot.contMap(tree.trait, type = "phylogram", legend = 0.4*max(nodeHeights(bird.orders)), fsize = c(0.9, 0.7), lwd=3, edge.width = 2, offset = 1,mar = c(2,4,3,2))
nodelabels(pie = pies, piecol = c("green","yellow"), cex = 0.6)

###Add tip labels colors based on trait1, but it could be on something entirely different.
tip.labels.col = c(rep(colors[1],6),"black",rep(colors[2],6),"black",rep(colors[3],10))
tiplabels(pch=15, cex=1.2, col= tip.labels.col,offset = 0.7)

#Add a title manually to plot.contMap
title("Figure 8 (adding pies)")
```

###7.Adding a map
```{r USA map, message=FALSE}
#Matrix of random USA GPS coordinates 
mat = matrix(c(sample(seq(from = 32, to = 45, by = 0.001),23),sample(seq(from = -120, to = -84, by = 0.001),23)),nrow = 23,ncol =2)
rownames(mat) = bird.orders$tip.label

###World mapping function (Here we are using a USA map, but this can be changes with the database option)
phylo.to.map(bird.orders,coords = mat, database = "usa")

#Add a title manually to plot.contMap
title("Figure 9 (USA map)",line = -3)
```
